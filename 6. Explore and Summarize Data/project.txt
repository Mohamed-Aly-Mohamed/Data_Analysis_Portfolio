# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?

> The dataset consists of 13 features with 1 variable as an index(X, fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, citric.acid, residual.sugar, chlorides, free.sulfur.dioxide, total.sulfur.dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality) and 1599 observations.

> Observations:
Most wine quality is at the middle range between 5 and 6
The alcoholic percentage seems to be mostly at 9.5%
Most of the pH value is between 3 and 3.5 which is acidic


### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

>The main features in the data set are alcohol and quality I’d like to determine which features are best for predicting the quality of wine, I suspect alcohol and some combination of the other variables can be used to build a predictive model to quality wine.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

> alcohol, pH, free.sulfur.dioxides, total.sulfur.dioxides, fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, residual.sugar likely contribute to the quality of red wine. I think alcohol and fixed.acidity probably contribute most to the quality after researching information on wine quality.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

> No

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?

>I log-transformed the right skewed sulphates, chlorides and any other right skewed distributions, to get a more suitable distribution to get a clear insight of the variable.

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

> quality correlates strongly with alcohol than other variables, so we can say that alcohol is a good variable to predict the quality of red wine. but with the aid of other features like pH, fixed.acidity and other features. we can get the full picture. as they are not correlated on each other as we see on alcohol and pH distribution.

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

> As the pH value increases the fixed acidity decreases which makes sense as it becomes neutral at the value of 7, they are strongly negative correlated.
when we change the fixed acidity with volatile acidity it becomes the opposite which makes sense.

### What was the strongest relationship you found?

> The fixed acidity is negative and strongly correlated with the pH value

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

> As a result of trying different combinations of features, it seems that it depends on them all together, there is no unique or specefic feature that influences the wine quality on it's own, but different combinations of features with a considerable effect of alcohol than other features.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

> A lot of features have no great effect on quality of wine, but a combination of different features together make the effect.


# Final Plots and Summary

### Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}
# Quality Histogram

ggplot(aes(x = quality), data = rw) +
  geom_histogram(fill = I('red'), color = I('black'))+
  ggtitle('Red Wine Quality on a scale from (0 -> 10)')
```

### Description One
> It's obvious that finding a high quality red wine is rare, and also for low quality wine.
we can find red wine quality to be mostly 5 or 6.
this distribution shows us the resultant red wine quality of our dataset.

### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}
# smoothed quality and alcohol scatterplot

ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = quality), data = rw)+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, position = 'jitter', fill = I('#F79420') , color = I('black') , shape = 21)+
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')+
  ggtitle('Red wine quality by alcohol percentage')+
  scale_x_continuous(name = 'alcohol percentage %')
```

### Description Two
> The most feature the affects the red wine quality from our dataset is the alcohol percentage, which seems to be positive correlated with the wine quality.

### Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three}
# free and total sulfur dioxides scatterplot, colored with alcohol
# and wraped with quality

ggplot(aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, y = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = rw)+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2,aes(color = alcohol) , position = 'jitter')+
  facet_wrap(~quality)+
  ggtitle('Facet wrap by quality with sulfur dioxide and alcohol effect ')

```

### Description Three
A combination of many features, improves our intuition of how these features affects red wine quality.
each feature has a different percentage of effect on wine quality as obviuos on the above distribution.
------

# Reflection

> I started exploring the red wine data variables and noticed the distribution of each feature alone in order to make an insight of the dataset features, to make full use of them in my exploration.
I founf that alcohol percentage is the most feature that is positive correlated with the quality, so i depends on it.
I faced some difficulties exploring the dataset, as there are no categorical features, which would help me in classifying the data and notice the effect of different categories on the same feature.
Also using an old dataset (2009) may deceive your intuition of the red wine quality for today.
For future exploration, I think larger and updated dataset may be helpful for better reliabilty, with some categorical features it will be great.
